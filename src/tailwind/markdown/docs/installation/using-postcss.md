### Installing Tailwind CSS as a PostCSS plugin

Installing Tailwind CSS as a PostCSS plugin is the most seamless way to integrate it with frameworks like Next.js and Angular.

#### Install Tailwind CSS

Install `tailwindcss`, `@tailwindcss/postcss`, and `postcss` via npm.

Terminal

```
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss postcss
```

#### Add Tailwind to your PostCSS configuration

Add `@tailwindcss/postcss` to your `postcss.config.mjs` file, or wherever PostCSS is configured in your project.

postcss.config.mjs

```
export default {  plugins: {    "@tailwindcss/postcss": {},  }}
```

#### Import Tailwind CSS

Add an `@import` to your CSS file that imports Tailwind CSS.

CSS

```
@import "tailwindcss";
```

#### Start your build process

Run your build process with `npm run dev` or whatever command is configured in your `package.json` file.

Terminal

```
npm run dev
```

#### Start using Tailwind in your HTML

Make sure your compiled CSS is included in the `<head>` *(your framework might handle this for you)*, then start using Tailwindâ€™s utility classes to style your content.

HTML

```
<!doctype html><html><head>  <meta charset="UTF-8">  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">  <link href="/dist/styles.css" rel="stylesheet"></head><body>  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold underline">    Hello world!  </h1></body></html>
```

**Are you stuck?** Setting up Tailwind with PostCSS can be a bit different across different build tools. Check our framework guides to see if we have more specific instructions for your particular setup.
