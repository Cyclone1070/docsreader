## Frequently asked questions

Everything you need to know.

### General

- Who can I contact about a sponsorship?

  If you have any questions about sponsoring, reach out to us at<!-- --> <support@tailwindcss.com> and we'll be happy to help.

  Can any company sponsor?

  We’re excited to have support from all kinds of companies who use Tailwind CSS, but we do have a few guidelines:

  - **We typically don’t accept sponsorships from companies that sell commercial Tailwind UI kits, templates, or component libraries**, since that directly overlaps with our own product offerings and can create confusion about what is officially endorsed.
  - **We also reserve the right to decline sponsorships from companies or services that we feel could reflect poorly on the project**, for example products that are low-quality or deceptive.

  If you're unsure whether your company qualifies, feel free to reach out — we're happy to chat.

  How are the sponsor perks delivered?

  After you check out via Polar, you'll get access to a Polar customer portal where you can manage your sponsorship and access any perks that come with it.

  If you're sponsoring as a company, we'll follow up to coordinate how to feature you on the Tailwind CSS website as well as how to give your team **Tailwind Insider** access.

  How are the sponsor perks licensed?

  Sponsor perks are provided under a custom commercial license.

  They’re licensed for personal or internal use by active Tailwind CSS Insiders sponsors only. Redistribution, sublicensing, or public sharing of the perks — such as the VS Code theme, Raycast extension, or Cursor/Claude/AGENTS.md rules — is not permitted.

### Support

- Do you offer technical support for sponsor perks?

  No — we don't offer technical support for sponsor perks. These perks are a bonus for supporters who want to give back to the project, but they're provided as-is.

  That said, the **Insiders Discord** is a great place to ask for help with anything related to the perks.

  How do I cancel my sponsorship?

  You can cancel your sponsorship at any time through the Polar customer portal. Once you cancel, your perks will remain active until the end of your current billing period.

  What happens if I stop sponsoring?

  If your sponsorship ends, you'll lose access to any perks like the Insiders Discord server, Cursor/Claude/AGENTS.md rules, and pre-release documentation. These are only available while you're actively sponsoring.

  What is your refund policy?

  Sponsorships are non-refundable, but of course you can cancel your sponsorship at any time.
