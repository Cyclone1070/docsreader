Learn how the creator of Tailwind CSS rapidly builds beautiful, robust user interfaces that are a joy to maintain.

In this course, you'll watch **complete UIs come together step-by-step**, with every decision and trade-off explained along the way. No simplified examples, just **real-world designs** with real-world challenges like the things you work on every day.

### What you'll learn

We'll speedrun the fundamentals to make sure you know your way around the framework, but after that it's all about turning **complex, modern UI designs into bullet-proof, maintainable code**.

We'll dig in to topics like:

- **Breaking down designs into composable pieces** that avoid coupling and duplication
- Approaching layout and spacing in a way that makes things **resilient to unexpected content**
- **Using modern CSS features** to reduce the need for complex JavaScript
- Handling dynamic, database-driven styles in **user-themeable applications**
- When to write **custom CSS** and how to approach it
- **How to design component APIs** when using utility-first CSS

And tons more, over the course of building a bunch of expertly designed, custom interfaces from complete scratch.
