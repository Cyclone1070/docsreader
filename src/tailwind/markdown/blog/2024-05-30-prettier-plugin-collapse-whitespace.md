We just released a new version of `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` which adds support for removing unnecessary whitespace and duplicate classes when sorting.

***

## [Cleaning up unnecessary whitespace](#cleaning-up-unnecessary-whitespace)

When you're copying around class names or deleting a class name from the middle of a list, it's easy to end up with some extra whitespace that needs to be cleaned up.

Now our Prettier plugin will handle this for you automatically, so you don't need to clean it up yourself.

## [Removing duplicate classes](#removing-duplicate-classes)

Our [VS Code extension](/docs/editor-setup#intellisense-for-vs-code) has warned you about duplicate class names for a long time, but now our Prettier plugin can remove those duplicate classes for you automatically.
